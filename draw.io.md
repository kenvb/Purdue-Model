# Draw.io tips
- You can't group shapes from different layers to 1 group like in Visio
- Lock the layers you are not working on. Too many times have I dragged a shape only for it to have jumped layer. By locking the other layers, this won't happen.
- The only time you need 3 layers unlocked is when you link a "dataflow" between an "asset" and a "subnet". As these are 3 different layers.
- The reason I choose to work with so many layers is because you can easily hide them when things get too crowded while still keeping all the necessary information in 1 document.
- Honestly... Layers are amazing once you get it in your fingers!
