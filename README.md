# Purdue Model Framework

A collection of Purdue model templates, depending on the need.

Sometimes it's nice to have a custom Purdue Model ready to get your point across.
I somehow noticed there aren't even any basic purdue model templates to be found on the interwebs. So i'll be dumping mine here in draw.io format.

If you hoped I was good at picking colours or making really shiny diagrams. Hah! Your loss!

## Mitre-enguinity
purdue-diagram.drawio

Used their (Mitre-enguinity) model as an inspiration, tried to use as many generic icons as possible so you can switch around their colors.

## OT (network) infrastructure mapped to the Purdue Model

purdue-model-network.drawio

This Purdue Model Framework is more seen from the OT network communication view between the different levels and asset types. Its goal is to provide a high level overview of the current asset types, subnets and protocols being present. To achieve this, it's best to go over the logs of scanners (passive or active), NGFW-logs or if you really feel like going nitty gritty: a tcpdump from a TAP-port on a central switch.

This example is to show you what the network diagram could look like. Go crazy and let me know if you come up with different ideas!
