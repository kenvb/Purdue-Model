# Purdue Model Framework

A collection of Purdue model templates, depending on the need.

Sometimes it's nice to have a custom Purdue Model ready to get your point across.
I somehow noticed there aren't even any basic purdue model templates to be found on the interwebs. So i'll be dumping mine here in draw.io format.

If you hoped I was good at picking colours or making really shiny diagrams. Hah! Your loss!

## Mitre-enguinity

Used their ([Mitre-enguinity](https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/our-work/defending-ot-with-attack/)) model as an inspiration, tried to use as many generic icons as possible so you can switch around their colors.

## OT (network) infrastructure mapped to the Purdue Model
[purdue-model-network.drawio](purdue-model-network.drawio)

This Purdue Model Framework variant is an OT network communication view between the different Purdue-levels and asset types. Its goal is to provide a high level overview of the current asset types, subnets and protocols being present. To achieve this, it's best to go over the logs of scanners (passive or active), NGFW-logs or if you really feel like going nitty gritty: a tcpdump from a TAP-port on a central switch.

I prepared a separate tab with asset types which you can add to your Model (like some of those in the example below) and some extra explanation on how the dataflows and this speciic version of the Purdue-model could be used.

### Example

This example is to show you what the network diagram could look like. Go crazy and let me know if you come up with different ideas!
