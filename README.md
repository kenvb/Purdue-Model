# Purdue-Model
A collection of Purdue model templates, depending on the need.

Sometimes it's nice to have a custom Purdue Model ready to get your point across.
I somehow noticed there aren't even any basic purdue model templates to be found on the interwebs. So i'll be dumping mine here in draw.io format.

If you hoped I was good at picking colours or making really shiny diagrams. Hah! Your loss!
